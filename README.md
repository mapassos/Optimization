<h2>Multiple Fitting with differential evolution algorithm</h2>

This is an algorithm used to fit the data collected from a espectroscopy experiment that I've done at the lab while I was an undergraduate.
We decided to used this algorithm because we had a non-linear data and only a few experiment data.
To obtain the correct fitted values, I defined upper and lower bounds for the parameters that I was trying to get.
