<h2>Multiple Fitting with differential evolution algorithm</h2>

This is an algorithm used to fit the data collected from a espectroscopy experiment that I've done at the lab while I was an undergraduate.
I decided to used this algorithm because we had a non-linear equation to fit and only a few experiment data, and the literature on the subject suggested that.
To obtain the correct fitted values, I defined upper and lower bounds for the parameters that I was trying to get, so we could get the global minima.
